# [Project 1: Monte Carlo Simulation - Optimal Production Level](https://github.com/JacobJones315/Monte-Carlo-Simulation_Optimal-Production-Level/tree/main)
* Created a program simulation written in Python that will generate a production level recommendation given a set of parameters
* Used NumPy to generate a random sample of demand instances from a normal (Gaussian) distribution and a 50% Uniform / 50% normal distribution.
* Used matplotlib to generate a scatterplot visualization with a color scale depicting optimal ranges of production

# [Project 2: Subway Yelp Reviews Analysis](https://github.com/JacobJones315/Subway_Yelp_Review-Analysis)
* Created a set of analyses and data visualizations that support or disprove the following statements made by Subway Restaurant leadership:
  * Head of Customer Service: “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 4.5/5.”
  * Head of Store Operations: “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from poor customer ratings.”
  * Head of Social Media: “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
  * Chief Data Scientist: “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only when they are either extremely angry or absolutely delighted with the service. So online ratings are not reliable.”
* Used matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to generate line charts, bar charts, and group by dataframes.

# [Project 3: Call of Duty Warzone: Projectile Weapons Time to Impact](https://github.com/JacobJones315/Call_of_Duty_Warzone)
* With the introduction of Call of Duty Warzone in 2019 simply aiming at your target was no longer sufficient, depending on the distance and weapon being used leading your projectile became necessary. 
* Developed a series of data visualizations illustrating how an individual weapon's bullet velocity and distance to the target influence the projectile's trajectory and the likelihood of hitting its intended mark if the target is moving.
* Used matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to generate line charts, heatmaps, and dataframes.
